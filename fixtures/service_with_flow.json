The language attribute of the page has not been set in the HTML. This may cause confusion to screen reader users who may not be able to identify the primary language of the page in their journey.\r\n3. Some pages may contain empty headings, including on the check answers page. As a result, screen reader users may have difficulty navigating these pages.\n4. Some content may be cut off or appear truncated when zooming in. This issue may affect low-vision users navigating the form who use reflow settings to view web pages.\r\n\r\nWe plan to fix these issues by July 2021.\r\n\r\n###Preparation of this accessibility statement\r\n\r\nThis statement was prepared on [date when it was first published].
